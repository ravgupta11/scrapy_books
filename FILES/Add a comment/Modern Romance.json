T Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the\u00a0pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation\u2019s sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get\u00a0into and out of relationships, all with the hope\u00a0of finding someone with whom we share a deep\u00a0connection. This seems standard now, but it\u2019s\u00a0wildly different from what people did even just\u00a0decades ago. Single people today have more\u00a0romantic options than at any point in human\u00a0history. With technology, our abilities to connect\u00a0with and sort through these options are staggering.\u00a0So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.\u00a0\u201cWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\u201d\u00a0\u201cShould I go out with this girl even though she\u00a0listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?\u00a0Combos?!\u201d \u201cMy girlfriend just got a message from\u00a0some dude named Nathan. Who\u2019s Nathan? Did he\u00a0just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check\u00a0just to be sure?\u201d\u00a0But the transformation of our romantic lives\u00a0can\u2019t be explained by technology alone. In a short\u00a0period of time, the whole culture of finding love\u00a0has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,\u00a0people would find a decent person who lived in\u00a0their neighborhood. Their families would meet\u00a0and, after deciding neither party seemed like a\u00a0murderer, they would get married and soon have\u00a0a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,\u00a0people marry later than ever and spend years of\u00a0their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a\u00a0soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his\u00a0comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern\u00a0Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take\u00a0things to another level. He teamed up with NYU\u00a0sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive\u00a0research project, including hundreds of interviews\u00a0and focus groups conducted everywhere from\u00a0Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed\u00a0behavioral data and surveys and created their own\u00a0online research forum on Reddit, which drew\u00a0thousands of messages. They enlisted the world\u2019s\u00a0leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen\u00a0Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry\u00a0Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any\u00a0social science or humor book we\u2019ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his\u00a0irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science\u00a0to give us an unforgettable tour of our new\u00a0romantic world. ...more"}]
