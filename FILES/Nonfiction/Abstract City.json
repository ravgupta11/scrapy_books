His posts were inspired by the desire to re-create simple and everyday observations and stories from his own life that everyone could relate to. In Niemann\u2019s hands, mundane experiences such as riding the subway or trying to get a good night\u2019s sleep were transformed into delightful flights of visual fancy. The struggle to keep up with housework became a battle against adorable but crafty goblins, and nostalgia about New York manifested in simple but strikingly spot-on LEGO creations. This brilliantly illustrated collection of reflections on modern life includes all 16 of the original blog posts as well as a new chapter created exclusively for the book. Also available from Christoph Niemann: Sunday Sketching and I LEGO N.Y. Praise for Abstract City: \u201cEveryday experiences\u2014from looking at leaves to riding city subways\u2014are funny and fresh and often a source of wonder when depicted by this brilliant graphic designer.\u201d \u2014Readers Digest \u201cI will call Christoph when anything awful happens to me. And he will make me laugh like crazy about the whole thing. Because he is insanely funny and completely tenderly true. I love every column he did and will do.\u201d \u2014Maira Kalman, author/illustrator of And the Pursuit of Happiness \u201cChristoph Niemann is the best illustrator alive. Every single time I come across a piece of his work, which is often as he either works all the time, or worse, draws incredibly fast, it is wonderful. While the rest of us are lucky to get a proper piece out here and there, Christoph produces hit after hit after hit. If he wasn\u2019t such a genuinely sweet man, we\u2019d surely hate his ass a lot.\u201d \u2014Stefan Sagmeister, author of Things I Have Learned in My Life So Far \u201cFew books have more probingly and humorously gotten inside the mind and day-to-day experience of an artist.\u201d \u2014NPR.org \"What\u2019s terrifying (to me, certainly, and possibly to many of his peers) is that nearly every idea he has seems to be equally well formed . . . once again, performing neat, virtuosic circles around the rest of us, to our delight.\" \u2014PRINT magazine \"Irresistible.\" \u2014Very Short List \u201cA masterpiece of sophisticated humor, this is a brilliant one-of-a-kind work.\u201d \u2014Library Journal, starred review ...more"}]
