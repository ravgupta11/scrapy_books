In this conversation with Vatican r NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022\u00a0In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal dialogue on the subject closest to his heart\u2014mercy\u2014which has long been the cornerstone of his faith and is now the central teaching of his papacy. In this conversation with Vatican reporter Andrea Tornielli, Francis explains\u2014through memories from his youth and moving anecdotes from his experiences as a pastor\u2014why \u201cmercy is the first attribute of God.\u201d God \u201cdoes not want anyone to be lost. His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,\u201d he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts\u2014on the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done. The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God\u2019s message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, The Name of God Is Mercy resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds. It is being published in more than eighty countries around the world.\u201cThe name of God is mercy. There are no situations we cannot get out of, we are not condemned to sink into quicksand.\u201d\u2014Pope FrancisPraise for The Name of God Is Mercy \u201cFrancis speaks succinctly\u2014and with refreshing forthrightness. . . . He emphasizes moral sincerity over dogma, an understanding of the complexities of the world and individual experience over rigid doctrine. . . . The pope has an easy conversational style that moves effortlessly between folksy sayings and erudite allusions, between common-sense logic and impassioned philosophical insights.\u201d\u2014Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times\u201cWhat makes his book most moving is the way in which this man, without disrespecting his own privacy or offering false bromides of modesty, opens the sacred space of his conscience to explain how he came to center his ministry, and now his papacy, around mercy.\u201d\u2014James Carroll, The New Yorker\u201cAs he has done throughout his papacy, Pope Francis shows in this book a compelling way to present God\u2019s love anew to a skeptical world without denying the ancient teachings of faith. But now he is challenging the entire Church to trek a new way forward.\u201d\u2014Time \u201cFrancis enjoys sharing personal stories of God\u2019s grace and mercy in the lives of parishioners from his native Argentina, people he has known and who have recognized themselves as sinners.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post\u201cPowerful . . . Francis\u2019s book signals a plea for a change of attitude on the part of the faithful and their pastors. . . . Bishops and priests will talk and quarrel over the text for months, even years to come. And that, perhaps, is what Francis intends.\u201d\u2014Financial Times \u201cDeepens his calls for a more merciful Catholic Church . . . The question-and-answer book is told in simple, breezy language, with the pope referring to experiences and people in his own life.\u201d\u2014Newsday \u201cFrancis has offered his most detailed outline yet for the role of the Catholic church in the modern era.\u201d\u2014National Catholic ReporterTranslated by Oonagh Stransky\u00a0From the Hardcover edition. ...more"}]
