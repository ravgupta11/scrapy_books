G On one side, there is Grace: prize-winning author Diana Abu-Jaber\u2019s tough, independent sugar-fiend of a German grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on anything: not about food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. Grace warned her away from children. Bud wanted her married above all\u2014even if he had to provide the ring. Caught between cultures and lavished with contradictory \u201cadvice\u201d from both sides of her family, Diana spent years learning how to ignore others\u2019 well-intentioned prescriptions.Hilarious, gorgeously written, poignant, and wise, Life Without a Recipe is Diana\u2019s celebration of journeying without a map, of learning to ignore the script and improvise, of escaping family and making family on one\u2019s own terms. As Diana discovers, however, building confidence in one\u2019s own path sometimes takes a mistaken marriage or two\u2014or in her case, three: to a longhaired boy-poet, to a dashing deconstructionist literary scholar, and finally to her steadfast, outdoors-loving Scott. It also takes a good deal of angst (was it possible to have a serious writing career and be a mother?) and, even when she knew what she wanted (the craziest thing, in one\u2019s late forties: a baby!), the nerve to pursue it.Finally, fearlessly independent like the Grace she\u2019s named after, Diana and Scott\u2019s daughter Gracie will heal all the old battles with Bud and, like her writer-mom, learn to cook up a life without a recipe. ...more"}]
