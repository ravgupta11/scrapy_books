His family gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain his marriage to a radiantly beautiful actress; his nineteen-year-old daughter, Petra, filled with voices and visions as she waits for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose relations with the Godley children are strained at best; and Petra\u2019s \u201cyoung man\u201d\u2014very likely more interested in the father than the daughter\u2014who has arrived for a superbly ill-timed visit.But the Godley family is not alone in their vigil. Around them hovers a family of mischievous immortals\u2014among them, Zeus, who has his eye on young Adam\u2019s wife; Pan, who has taken the doughy, perspiring form of an old unwelcome acquaintance; and Hermes, who is the genial and omniscient narrator: \u201cWe too are petty and vindictive,\u201d he tells us, \u201cjust like you, when we are put to it.\u201d As old Adam\u2019s days on earth run down, these unearthly beings start to stir up trouble, to sometimes wildly unintended effect. . . . Blissfully inventive and playful, rich in psychological insight and sensual detail, The Infinities is at once a gloriously earthy romp and a wise look at the terrible, wonderful plight of being human\u2014a dazzling novel from one of the most widely admired and acclaimed writers at work today. ...more"}]
