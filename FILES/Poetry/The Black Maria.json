There is in her art the vulnerability of one who lives inside of the stories that she gathers in this remarkable collection. Her poems set off alarms even as they transform the world she inhabits, showing us, in the process, exactly what she asks of Romare Bearden\u2019s art: \u2018\u2026how not to // assign all blackness near the sea / a captivity.\u2019 This is one of the many sweet contradictions in the black maria, which \u2018is a black flag / wounding the pastoral.\u2019 I am deeply thankful that we have a poet of her unique and singular talent writing today.\" \u2014Kwame DawesTaking its name from the moon's dark plains, misidentified as seas by early astronomers, the black maria investigates African diasporic histories, the consequences of racism within American culture, and the question of human identity.
