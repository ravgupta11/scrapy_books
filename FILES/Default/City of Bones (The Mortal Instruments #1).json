Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing\u2015not even a smear of blood\u2015to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons.
